# predictwell-diabetes
 A user-friendly web application that uses machine learning to predict the risk of diabetes based on health parameters like glucose, BMI, insulin, and more. Built to raise awareness and encourage proactive health management.
 ## 📝 Abstract

Diabetes is a rapidly growing global health concern, and early detection is key to effective management and prevention. This project, **PredictWell**, is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, insulin level, age, and more.

 A **Random Forest Classifier** was used to train the model due to its robustness and ability to handle complex relationships within the data. Important features like glucose levels, BMI, and age were identified as strong predictors of diabetes risk.

The model’s performance was evaluated using key metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall**, and **F1-score**, confirming its effectiveness in predicting diabetes. The system is integrated into a user-friendly web interface where users can input health data and receive real-time prediction results along with health suggestions.

This project demonstrates the potential of AI-driven tools in preventive healthcare, empowering users with data-driven insights and encouraging proactive health management.
